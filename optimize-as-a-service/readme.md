# Running Camunda Optimize on PCF

Optimize is a business analysis tool that can make sense of data in Camunda engines. Please not that this is not available within the community edition and needs an enterprise subscription. Nevertheless I wanted to include it here, as customers ask about it anyway.

Optimize is - like the Camunda engine - a Java application, so you can also run it using the Java build pack of PCF. In order to properly configure Optimize this repo provides a small overlay project you can build and push, either locally, or again using your CI/CD pipeline.
